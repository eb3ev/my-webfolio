A portfolio about myself â€” featuring my projects and achievements using creative
use of web design principles.

[GitHub Page](https://eb3ev.github.io/my-webfolio)

## To do

- [ ] Have multiple themes (including web layout) for the site using different
design principles and/or frameworks (if possible).
- [ ] Interactive sections for the different projects that simulate them
(if possible).
- [ ] Make a simple interactive game of my hobbies.
- [ ] Have a database that uses PHP that contains the information (if possible
considering this is deployed as a static website).
- [ ] Include graphical effects (animations and particle effects).
- [ ] Ensure standard coding practices for web development.
- [ ] Show a 'see through' functionality for the workings of the site?
